Learning the basics of Python

Hello GitHub world,

I'm working on learning the basics of Python and starting to experiment with open source data in order to learn more about data science and machine learning models. I'm currently studying a masters degree in economics but am pursuing careers more closely tied data and exploratory modelling!

I'm new to GitHub, am learning the format and how it can be used.
