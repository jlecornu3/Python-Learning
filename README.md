Learning the basics of Python

Hello GitHub world,

I'm working on learning the basics of Python and starting to experiment with open source data in order to learn more about data science and machine learning models. I'm currently studying a masters degree in economics but am pursuing a career more closely tied to data and exploratory modelling!
