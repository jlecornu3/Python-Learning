Learning the basics of Python

Hello GitHub world,

I'm working on learning the basics of Python and starting to experiment with open source data in order to learn more about data science and machine learning models. I'm currently studying a masters degree in economics but am pursuing a career more closely tied to data and exploratory modelling!

I'm new to GitHub, am learning the format and how it can be used.

Uploaded currently are a sample of the scripts that I have worked through via Online courses (available from my emails). Given the current pandemic scenario I am not currently in Oxford, so do not have access to my full set of scripts and and raw data files. There are various sample datasets available, but again these are only those I was able to recover without access to my harddrive.
